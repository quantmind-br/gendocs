      "Sequential extraction pattern: Successful agent extraction follows a remove-first pattern - create new file first, then remove from original",

    "gotchas_discovered": [
      "Dependency chain: DocumenterAgent removal from analyzer.go must happen after successful creation of documenter.go to avoid compilation errors",

    "recommendations": [
      "Continue with AIRulesGeneratorAgent extraction using the same pattern - create new file first, then remove from analyzer.go",

      "Document the extraction pattern for future similar refactoring tasks",
      "Monitor the remaining analyzer.go file size to determine if further agent extractions are needed",
